I’m especially fascinated by the mysteries of science — quantum theories, the universe, and the unseen forces that shape our world. What excites me most is making sense of complexity, turning curiosity into understanding, and turning questions into discovery. I believe learning never stops — it’s a journey, not a destination. Every day, I strive to grow a little more, think a little deeper, and explore a little further. My motto: <em>“Learn constantly, grow continuously.”</em></p> <p>Pekua, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh<br> ✉️ <a href="shihabium@gmail.com">Gmail</a><br> 🌐 <a href="https://github.com/shihabium" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a><br> 📞 +XXX-XXXXXXXXXX 💬 “Curious mind.
